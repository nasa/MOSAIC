MOSAIC provides scheduling tools to allocate computational tasks to robots with heterogeneous computational capabilities and time-varying communication links. 

This package contains three+1 scheduling and task allocation algorithm.

- :ref:`time_varying` (``tv_milp``).  A mixed-integer programming algorithm for scheduling tasks in heterogeneous robotic networks with time-varying communication links. The scheduler can accommodate any non-cyclical dependencies between tasks and arbitrary time-varying communication links, handle optional tasks with associated rewards, and optimize cost functions including rewards for optional tasks, makespan, and energy usage. The scheduler is presented in \[1\].

- :ref:`time_invariant`  (``ti_milp``). A mixed-integer programming algorithm for task allocation in  heterogeneous robotic networks with *periodic* communication links. The task allocation algorithm also accommodates any non-cyclical dependencies between tasks and handles optional tasks with associated rewards and maximum latency requirements; it can maximize reward from optional tasks or minimize energy use. The task allocation algorithm is presented in \[2\].

- For benchmarking purposes, we also provide a lightly modified version of Topcuoglu, Hariri, and Wu's `Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) <#references>`__ algorithm (``heft``).

- A scheduling algorithm (``ti_milp_heft``) that uses the proposed task allocation algorithm to assign tasks to agents, and HEFT (with fixed task allocation) to schedule task execution.

For a full description of the algorithm, we refer the interested reader to `our papers <#references>`__.
